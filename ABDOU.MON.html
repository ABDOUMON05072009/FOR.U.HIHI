		<h1>A Love Letter to Monia</h1>
		<p>
			Dear Monia,
			<br><br>
			I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my feelings for you, as I've been carrying them around for quite some time now.
			<br><br>
			From the moment I met you, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile, your laugh, the way your eyes light up when you talk about your passions - it all drew me in.
			<br><br>
			As I got to know you better, I found myself falling for you more and more each day. Your kindness, your intelligence, your sense of humor - it all made me realize that you're the one I want to spend the rest of my life with.
			<br><br>
			I know that we've only just started our journey together, but I can't help but feel like we're meant to be. I want to explore the world with you, to build a life together, and to create a future filled with love and happiness.
			<br><br>
			I know that love can be scary, but I also know that it's worth it. I'm willing to take the risk, to put my heart on the line, and to fight for us.
			<br><br>
			So here I am, pouring my heart out to you, hoping that you feel the same way. I know that I can't force you to feel a certain way, but I also know that I have to take this chance.
			<br><br>
			I hope that you'll consider giving us a chance, that you'll see what I see in you, and that you'll let me love you the way you deserve to be loved.
			<br><br>
			With all my heart,
			<br>
			ABDESSLAM
